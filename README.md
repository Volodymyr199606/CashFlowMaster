# 🚀 Main Class: The Main class is the entry point of your application. It contains the main method which starts the application. It creates a Scanner object for reading user input, a Ledger object for managing transactions, and a Reports object for generating reports. The main loop of the application displays a menu to the user and waits for their input. Depending on the user's choice, it calls different methods to handle different actions such as adding a deposit, making a payment, displaying the ledger, running reports, or exiting the application.
